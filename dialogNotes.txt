==== Reading Multiple Lines ====

=> activeInHierarchy (useful later)
uses GetButton w/ Input Manager (might be good w/ spacebar)
(Project Settings => Input)
(Fire1 = left ctrl, mouse 0)
GetButton vs. GetButtonUp
prevent out of range errors (deactivate dialog box when we get to end)
setActive(false)

==== Activating And Switching Lines ====

different dialog in different situations
new script for NPC (DialogActivator)
put collider on NPC
When character collides with NPC (should be solid), NPC will activate dialog and set dialog text

=== Activating And Switching Lines Pt. 2 ===

two box colliders for girl -- one on enter allowing talk, one to keep from covering
pressing button activates dialogue
make instance of DialogManager accessible
DialogActivator has array of strings for dialog text (I used file)
When player is in area, check to see if they press button (set flag on entering dialog area)
** Only activate if the collider is the player!
On exiting, can activate is false
if you can activate and the player fires, open dialog box
create function that activator will call to start dialog manager managing dialog flow (I gave it the lines and let it do the rest)
set currentLine in dialogManager to 0
display first line and get ready to display more on user input
** You can use debug view to debug Unity (inspector)!
Bug: second line of text appears instead of first
The first appears too fast (confusion of fire between opening dialog box and skipping to next line)
solution: check if the dialog box is active (seems like a different issue, like closing right away) -- and use justStarted flag in DialogManager to keep from advancing lines if justStarted is set. (I dunno -- this doesn't address the underlying issue, which is the duplication of fire event between the two components)
next issue: player can move when talking
solution: set flag to keep player from moving when talking?

=== Keeping the Character From Moving ===

My strategy: flag in PlayerController with set method -- dialog activator sets and clears flag, flag prevents motion.
