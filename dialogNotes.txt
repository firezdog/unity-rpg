==== Reading Multiple Lines ====

=> activeInHierarchy (useful later)
uses GetButton w/ Input Manager (might be good w/ spacebar)
(Project Settings => Input)
(Fire1 = left ctrl, mouse 0)
GetButton vs. GetButtonUp
prevent out of range errors (deactivate dialog box when we get to end)
setActive(false)

==== Activating And Switching Lines ====

different dialog in different situations
new script for NPC (DialogActivator)
put collider on NPC
When character collides with NPC (should be solid), NPC will activate dialog and set dialog text
