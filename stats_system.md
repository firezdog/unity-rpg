# Section 7: Leveling Up
Keep track of player stats on individual characters using stat manager script

This should be really simple -- just a script with some variables (like health, magic, exp), getters, setters -- attached to player. Tricky point might be making sure that player doesn't get new stats each time she loads. Maybe instead of putting script on character, it is put on game manager (singleton) object?
